## Building for production 🏗

To build a static site for production, run the following command

```shell
npm run build
```

The generated site will be written to the `.next` folder. The contents of this folder can be deployed by a serverless deployment platform such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). You can test the production build by running `npm run build && npm run start`.

## Model Providers

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-title=Next.js+Chat&demo-description=A+full-featured%2C+hackable+Next.js+AI+chatbot+built+by+Vercel+Labs&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.vercel.ai%2F&demo-image=%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fe5382hct74si%2F4aVPvWuTmBvzM5cEdRdqeW%2F4234f9baf160f68ffb385a43c3527645%2FCleanShot_2023-06-16_at_17.09.21.png&project-name=Next.js+Chat&repository-name=nextjs-chat&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel-labs%2Fai-chatbot&from=templates&skippable-integrations=1&env=OPENAI_API_KEY%2CAUTH_GITHUB_ID%2CAUTH_GITHUB_SECRET%2CAUTH_SECRET&envDescription=How+to+get+these+env+vars&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel-labs%2Fai-chatbot%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&teamCreateStatus=hidden&stores=[{"type":"kv"}])

## Creating a KV Database Instance

Follow the steps outlined in the [quick start guide](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv/quickstart#create-a-kv-database) provided by Vercel. This guide will assist you in creating and configuring your KV database instance on Vercel, enabling your application to interact with it.

Remember to update your environment variables (`KV_URL`, `KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`) in the `.env` file with the appropriate credentials provided during the KV database setup.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
