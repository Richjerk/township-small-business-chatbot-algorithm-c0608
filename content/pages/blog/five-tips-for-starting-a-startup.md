3.  **Embrace Innovation and Technology:**

    1.  Technology is a powerful enabler for startups. Embrace digital tools, platforms, and e-commerce to reach a broader audience. Innovate and explore opportunities in sectors like fintech, agritech, healthtech, and edtech, which are thriving in South Africa.

4.  **Build Strong Networks:**
